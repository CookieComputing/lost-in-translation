# lost-in-translation
A Python based mini-project exploring Google Translate's API

## What is this project?

This is a small side project of mine to explore Google's Translate API, as well as to create a quirky project that 
emphasizes both the difficulty and hilarity that is translating information from a swath of languages, and how nuances
in one language can easily be lost in another.
